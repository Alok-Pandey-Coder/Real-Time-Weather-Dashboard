# Real-Time Weather Dashboard 🌦️

A modern, responsive web application that provides live weather insights using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. This project demonstrates advanced **Asynchronous JavaScript** patterns and **State-Driven UI** updates.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Advanced Gradients & Flexbox)
* **Data Source:** OpenWeatherMap API
* **Methods:** Fetch API, Async/Await, DOM Manipulation

## ✨ Core Features
-   **Live Data Fetching:** Utilizes `Async/Await` to retrieve real-time temperature, humidity, and wind conditions.
-   **Dynamic UI Rendering:** The interface theme and background gradients change automatically based on weather conditions (Clear, Clouds, Rain, etc.).
-   **Robust Error Management:** Implemented `try...catch` blocks and response validation to handle invalid city names or network failures gracefully.
-   **Responsive Architecture:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using CSS media queries.

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights
-   **JSON Parsing:** Efficiently destructures complex nested JSON objects from API responses to drive UI updates.
-   **Event Loop Management:** Used non-blocking I/O to ensure a smooth user experience while waiting for external server responses.
-   **Clean Architecture:** Separated concerns between the Data Fetching layer (API) and the Presentation layer (DOM).

## 📂 Installation
